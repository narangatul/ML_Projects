# Polynomial Regression

In statistics, polynomial regression is a form of regression analysis in which the relationship between the independent variable x and the dependent variable y is modelled as an nth degree polynomial in x. Polynomial regression fits a nonlinear relationship between the value of x and the corresponding conditional mean of y, denoted E(y |x), and has been used to describe nonlinear phenomena such as the growth rate of tissues,[1] the distribution of carbon isotopes in lake sediments,[2] and the progression of disease epidemics.[3] Although polynomial regression fits a nonlinear model to the data, as a statistical estimation problem it is linear, in the sense that the regression function E(y | x) is linear in the unknown parameters that are estimated from the data. For this reason, polynomial regression is considered to be a special case of multiple linear regression.

\begin{equation}\label{poly}  Y=\beta _{0}+\beta _{1}X +\beta_{2}X^{2}+\ldots+\beta_{h}X^{h}+\epsilon,  \end{equation}
